# pokerbots
Our 2016 pokerbots competition code (coded by me and Sourav Das) for a 2-player pot-limit Omaha poker game. 
Original repository is located at https://github.com/SouravD18/Project16
Some code was taken from Steve Brecher's HoldEmShowdown program, especially to evaluate equity. 

Run engine_1.4.jar to start a game against an example bot.
